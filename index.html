        <!-- Biography Text -->
        <p> My name is Case Griffiths. I am originally from La Jolla California which is a small surfing town North West of San Diego. I moved to Berkeley on Scholarship to the University of California where I received my Bachelors in Digital Media, after which I moved to Portland, Oregon where I live now with my girlfriend Jeanelle and our beagle puppy Harley.</p>
        <p>I have been working in technology for my entire life. I started by building my first computer at age 9. It was a broken Windows PC that my mom said I could have if I could fix it. I tinkered with it for days and eventually surmised that it was the video card that was broken. I asked my mom for a new video card and it was my only Christmas present in 1996. It worked. That moment would mark the beginning of a life long passion for tech.</p>
        <p> Today, I have worked for some of the world's premier technology companies, such as Sony, Qualcomm, Apple, and Salesforce. I work on PCs, Macs, and Linux. I am a certified Apple repair tech, and now I work at marketing technology start ups in Downtown Portland, the most recent being my current employer, Opal Labs.</p>
        <p>In my free time I like to tinker with technology, fly drones, go camping, play music, and see shows. I have recently gotten into rock climbing, and now I am training to become a web developer.</p>
