                <p style="padding: 20px; text-align: left; text-indent: 30px"> My name is Case Griffiths. I am
                    originally from La Jolla
                    California which is a small surfing
                    town North West of San Diego. I moved to Berkeley on Scholarship to the University of
                    California where I received my Bachelors in Digital Media, after which I moved to Portland,
                    Oregon where I live now with my girlfriend Jeanelle and our beagle puppy Harley.</p>
                <br>
                <p style="text-align: left; text-indent: 30px">I have been working in technology for my entire life. I
                    started by building my first computer at
                    age 9. It was a broken Windows PC that my mom said I could have if I could fix it. I tinkered
                    with it for days and eventually surmised that it was the video card that was broken. I asked my
                    mom for a new video card and it was my only Christmas present in 1996. It worked. That moment
                    would mark the beginning of a life long passion for tech.</p>
                <br>
                <p style="text-align: left; text-indent: 40px"> Today, I have worked for some of the world's premier
                    technology companies, such as Sony,
                    Qualcomm, Apple, and Salesforce. I work on PCs, Macs, and Linux. I am a certified Apple repair
                    tech, and now I work at marketing technology start ups in Downtown Portland, the most recent
                    being my current employer, Opal Labs.</p>
                <br>
                <p style="text-align: left; text-indent: 40px">In my free time I like to tinker with technology, fly
                    drones, go camping, play music, and see
                    shows. I have recently gotten into rock climbing, and now I am training to become a web
                    developer.</p>
